--------
2.0 beta
--------

Plus:
  Engine and Dev Kit ported to Mac OS X.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-01-05)
---------------------

Engine:
* Settings are saved.
* Settings and saved games are now read and written to proper locations (AppData on Windows and Application Support on Mac).
* There is a new setting (not available in the user interface): FIXEDPIXELS. If enabled, the engine won't scale the window. I've used this for testing (see next point in the list), but don't recommend its general use. I'd rather fix any errors with the scaling than work around it.
* Improved placement of graphics. I made a test game, which now renders properly. Some things were a couple of pixels off earlier.

Development Kit:
* Preferences are saved.
* Updated the documentation to reflect the changes regarding ini files.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-01-08)
---------------------

Dev Kit
* Added a new function: setCharacterAngleOffset as requested in the wishlist thread.
* Fixed registration of Help Book. (Please let me know if it doesn't work properly. As this is a system wide thing, it's difficult to test on a single machine.)

Engine
* Added function setCharacterAngleOffset. Warning! This makes saved games made with earlier versions of the 2.0 beta engine incompatible with the current version. Trying to use them will most likely cause the program to crash. (Saved games made with SLUDGE 1.x will be read just fine, but as the engine is in beta I didn't safeguard the 2.0 saves.)
* Fixed a (Windows only) bug that caused some keypresses not to be reported correctly.
* Added a setting (NOSTARTUPWINDOW) to suppress the startup window.
* Fixed the long-annoying bug that caused partially transparent objects to make the backdrop transparent when pasted to it. (As happens when doing a freeze.)

That last bugfix also marks the first use of shader programming in SLUDGE. It'll be interesting to hear if that cause problems for anyone.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-01-31)
---------------------

Engine
* Ported to Linux.
* Bugfix: Fixed the bug that Erwin found that could prevent the engine from starting on some Windows machines.
* Bugfix: The engine no longer dies if fed bad sound data. (This bug could prevent Out of Order from being played to the end on some computers.)
* Bugfix: Wrong language could be selected in the startup window.
* Bugfix: A bug in the handling of translations prevented Cubert Badbone from starting on Linux.
* Bugfix: Fixed a bug that would crash the engine if loading a saved game with a scene size different than the current one.
* Bugfix: Fixed mixOverlay to work as it should.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-02-13)
---------------------

Engine
* Sound engine has changed from BASS to OpenAL. Windows users may need to install OpenAL using the supplied installer program. (This also means that support for MO3 and MP3 files has been removed. The only released game affected by this is Frasse and the Peas of Kejick, which no longer runs properly. All other games should run pretty much as well as before, except for one sound at the end of Out of Order that gives an error message.)
* The game path is now searched for additional files. This allows games like Nathan's Second Chance to be packaged up neatly.
* Should now run properly on big-endian (i.e. PowerPC) systems too. (I hope.)

Dev Kit
* Should now run properly on big-endian (i.e. PowerPC) systems too. (I hope.)
* Added a workaround to support older graphics cards.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-03-28)
---------------------

Engine
* Added support for sounds in animations. (The change is all in the engine, so the new feature can be used by people stuck with the Windows dev kit, too.) Warning: This required a change to the save game format, so once again save games made with earlier beta versions are broken. (But all non-beta saves remains supported, of course.)
* Fixed a bug in the sound code that would crash the engine if fed a game that's forced silent by the dev kit setting.
* Linux: Changed build process from handwritten makefiles to autotools.

Dev Kit
* Mac: Made the script editor actually useable. It now supports undo/redo, copy/paste, searching, and basic syntax colouring.
* The translation editor will now remove unused strings.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-04-05)
---------------------

Engine
* Fixed some bugs related to the recent addition with sound files in animations.
* Fixed the behaviour of pasted images.
* Fixed a bug that corrupted the background when pasting sprites.
* Fixed a bug that would corrupt saved games.
* Added support for PNG images in parallax layers.

Dev Kit
* Made compilation (adding of resources) a bit faster. (Frasse is getting a lot of resource files now that I'm adding voices, so it was starting to feel slow.)
* Added a Run Game button to the compiler window.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-05-01)
---------------------

Engine
* The launch() function now works properly.
* Bugfix: Sounds were always started at full volume.
* (Mac) The engine eats the Command+F keypress properly. (No more beeps.)
* Bugfix: "Hard scrolling" was messing up.
* Tweaked character walking to be smoother. Characters no longer twitch if they're given a new target while walking, and a change of costume no longer stops a walk. (I hope this doesn't break anything...)
* Bugfix: Fixed a hidden bug related to snapshots.

Dev Kit
* (Mac): Added Fontify command. (Note that unlike the old behaviour found in the Windows Dev Kit, it handles transparency in the same way as the rest of the program.)
* Made the compiler's (probably mostly the linker) error reporting slightly more informative. (No more _str1679.)
* Bugfix: The zBuffer editor now displays the buffers properly again.
* Bugfix: Adding 8-bit images to a sprite bank didn't work properly.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-05-02)
---------------------

Engine
* New feature: Sound lists.

Dev Kit
* Allow large sprite in a font. (I removed the limit of 256 pixels. While that's probably enough for anyone, there was no reason for the limit to be there.)
* Fixed loading of transparency in 16-bit TGA images in the Sprite Bank editor.

--------------------------------------------------------
2.0 beta (2010-05-23) - including experimental shader AA
--------------------------------------------------------

Warning: This build breaks save game compatibility with earlier 2.0 betas. (But it will still load save games from 1.x if you have those.)

New built-in functions:
* setCharacterTransparency
* setCharacterColourise

Plus:
* Updated the Docs on loopSound.
* I've experimented with shaders and antialiasing. If you press Alt+A while playing a game you can toggle the experimental shader on/off for characters and backgrounds. Please note that lighting and drawing modes are not implemented in this shader yet.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-05-30)
---------------------

* (Mac): Gamedata.slg file should now be in the Resources folder rather than the MacOS folder in an .app bundle.
* Shader antialiasing experiment: The old behaviour is still the default, but you can try it out by pressing Alt+A. It now handles drawing modes and lighting properly, and it doesn't add saturation and contrast. It's also a bit more subtle and operates on actual pixel size of the screen rather than texel size (pixel size of the sprites). I haven't done any speed tests, but as I've simplified things a bit I expect it to be faster.
The shader programs now live in their own files (something that makes working on them a lot easier for me), so if you're curious you can look at them easily. On Windows, they're just loose files, and on Mac they live in the Resources folder in the .app bundle. scale.vert and scale.frag are the files dealing with this.

---------------------
2.0 beta (2010-06-29)
---------------------

Warning: This build breaks save game compatibility with earlier 2.0 betas. (But it will still load save games from 1.x if you have those.)

New built-in functions:
* zoomCamera

* Made the new antialiasing the default, and added a setting to disable aa completely. (When disabled, no interpolation at all is done, so the old linear interpolation is completely gone.)
* Some small changes to the graphics rendering code. It may be a bit faster now.
* Removed the old anti-aliasing functions.
* Documented the recently added functions setCharacterColourise and setCharacterTransparency.
* Added a block-commenting function to the script editor (found in the Edit menu, or Cmd+B).

-------------------------------------------------------
2.0 beta (2010-07-06) - Now with a compiler for Windows
-------------------------------------------------------

* The Project Manager/Compiler is now available for Windows too. This means that Windows users no longer are restricted to version 1.7. (I included the other tools in the download too, but they're the 1.7 versions. I'll update them too in the future.) The documentation is also updated. (It won't open from the menu or the button in the program, but the chm file is included.)
* Faster anti-aliasing.
* Rewrote the freezing code to preserve zooming.
* Documented the zoomCamera function
* Added support for a custom logo in the startup window

-----------------------------------------------------------
2.0 beta (2010-10-23) - with Dev. Kit for Linux and Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------

Plus:
* Released GTK+ version of Dev Kit working on Linux and Windows.

Engine:
* Added linear interpolation as an antialiasing-option.
* Windows: The startup window is prettier.
* Bugfix: The fixedpixels setting now works.
* Bugfix: There was a bug that corrupted snapshots in saved games.
* Bugfix: Now works properly on computers with graphics cards unable to handle textures on non-power-of-two sizes.
* Added an error message if the shaders fail.
* Debugging information (for the engine - no game debugging features yet) can now be enabled by the ini file.

Mac Dev Kit:
* Bugfix: Things could be a bit messed up if more than one project was open at the same time. This is now fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------
2.0 beta (2010-11-14) - Update of Linux/Windows Dev Kit
-------------------------------------------------------

GTK Dev Kit:
* Added the missing features:
    * Translation Editor
    * Fontify
    * "Run Game" button on Windows
* Some bugfixes:
    * Adding files to projects now works properly also on Windows.
    * Loading files with strange encodings doesn't crash the Project Manager on Windows anymore.

-------------------------
2.0 - Finally out of beta
-------------------------

Documentation:
* The Documentation has been updated, and should now be completely current.

Engine bugfixes:
* Fixed a bug that could cause hardScroll() to malfunction.
* (Windows): The engine would hang if the windows key was pressed while in full screen mode.
* (Windows): Worked around a bug in ATI drivers for older cards that would crash.
* (Windows): Fixed an issue with the startup if the DPI setting is unusual.

Dev Kit:
* Fixed creation of new projects to hide mouse cursor properly.

Mac Dev Kit:
* Added "New Script File" to the Tools menu.
* Re-worked how projects are treated. You may note that the items in the project menu aren't greyed out as much anymore. When creating a new script or translations, the dev kit also offers to add it automatically to the current project.

GTK Dev Kit:
* Windows installer added.
* Bugfix: Allow for cut-off points larger than the scene height.
* Translation editor: Allow for searching in strings.

----------------------
2.0.1 - Bugfix release

* Changed the logo in the documentation to a new one made by Erwin Broekhuis.
* Bugfix: The compiler could crash on certain errors.

GTK Development Kit:
* Bugfix: Fixed some crashes that would occur if the dev kit was compiled differently.

---------------------
2.1.0 - Movie support
---------------------

General:
* Added movie support.

Engine (Windows):
* Bugfix: Input with a pen and tablet was all messed up in full screen mode. This bug also interfered with Alt+Tab task switching.

Development Kit (general):
* Added some tracking of line numbers to the compiler, to enable more detailed error reporting. 

GTK Development Kit:
* Bugfix: Clicking on the same compiler error in the projectmanager twice could cause a crash.
* Bugfix: Sprites could disappear if the graphical tools were compiled differently.
